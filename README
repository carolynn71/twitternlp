Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using the Sentiment140 Twitter dataset. The model is trained using Logistic Regression, and it classifies tweets into positive and negative sentiments after preprocessing and vectorization.

📝 Project Overview
This sentiment analysis system leverages machine learning to determine whether a given tweet expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The Sentiment140 dataset contains 1.6 million pre-labeled tweets, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating the model.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Sentiment140 Dataset

The dataset contains 1,600,000 tweets.

Original labels: 0 = Negative, 4 = Positive → converted to 0 = Negative, 1 = Positive

Only the tweet text and sentiment label are used for model training.

📌 Features
Preprocessing: Cleaning text, lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming

Vectorization using TF-IDF

Train-test split with sklearn

Model training with LogisticRegression

Accuracy evaluation on both training and testing data

Model serialization using pickle

Prediction on new tweets
